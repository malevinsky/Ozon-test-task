*vegetarian recipe*


> “These are the simplest pancakes to make with kids. You don’t even need scales to weigh out the ingredients - all you need is a cup or a mug. As long as you use the same cup for measuring both the flour and the milk, you’ll be laughing! ”

## Ingredients
* 1 large free-range egg
* 1 cup of self-raising flour
* 1 cup of milk
* 200 g blueberries
* olive oil
* 4 tablespoons natural yoghurt

## Method
1. Crack the egg into a large mixing bowl, add the flour, milk and a tiny pinch of sea salt.
2. Whisk everything together until you have a lovely smooth batter, then fold through the blueberries.
3. Heat ½ a tablespoon of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, carefully tilting the pan to spread the oil out evenly.
4. Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to work in batches.
5. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then carefully flip them over.
6. When the pancakes are golden on both sides, remove to a plate.
7. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a little more oil to the pan between batches, if needed.
8. Serve the pancakes while they’re still hot, with a dollop of yoghurt and some extra fresh berries, if you like.
